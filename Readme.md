# Truffle Achievements

Built to be a basic embed, showcasing what viewer "Achievements" could look like. Still pretty rough around the edges and not ready for actual usage.

## Tools used:

- Back-end is built off of [Thin-backend](https://thin.dev/) (A bit similar to Firebase in concept)
- TailwindCSS is used for styling (Many of the more complex styles are based off of [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) for speed of dev)

For the Truffle Embed Hackathon.
